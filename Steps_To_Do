Introduction: 
In today's digital landscape, extracting text from images is a critical task for various applications, from 
document processing to data analysis. Leveraging the power of cloud computing, particularly 
Amazon Web Services (AWS), offers a scalable and efficient solution for image text extraction. In this 
project, we have developed a system that utilizes AWS S3, API Gateway, Lambda, and Amazon 
Textract to extract text from images seamlessly. 
Objective: 
The primary objective of this project is to create an automated system capable of extracting text 
from images uploaded to an AWS S3 bucket. By harnessing AWS services, we aim to streamline the 
text extraction process, eliminate manual intervention, and enhance overall efficiency. 
Technologies Used: 
1. Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service): S3 provides secure, durable, and scalable object storage. 
We utilize S3 to store the images from which text extraction is performed. 
2. API Gateway: API Gateway enables us to create, publish, maintain, and monitor APIs at any 
scale. We have configured an API endpoint to trigger the text extraction process. 
3. AWS Lambda: Lambda allows us to run code without provisioning or managing servers. We 
deploy a Lambda function to execute the text extraction process whenever the API endpoint is 
invoked. 
4. Amazon Textract: Textract is a machine learning service that automatically extracts text and 
data from scanned documents. We leverage Textract to extract text from images uploaded to S3. 
Workflow: 
1. Upload Image to S3: Users upload images containing text to an S3 bucket dedicated to storing 
extractable images. 
2. Invoke API Endpoint: Upon image upload, the user triggers the text extraction process by 
invoking the API endpoint created using API Gateway. 
3. Lambda Execution: The API Gateway triggers a Lambda function, which retrieves the 
uploaded image from the S3 bucket and initiates the text extraction process using Textract. 
4. Text Extraction: Textract analyzes the image, identifies text elements, and extracts the text 
content. 
5. Output Generation: The extracted text is returned as output, which can be further processed, 
stored, or used in downstream applications. 
Benefits: 
Scalability: 
AWS services offer scalability, allowing the system to handle a large volume of images and text 
extraction requests efficiently. 
 
-Automation: 
The entire text extraction process is automated, reducing the need for manual intervention and 
enabling seamless integration into existing workflows. 
 
Accuracy: 
Amazon Textract employs advanced machine learning algorithms to accurately extract text from 
images, ensuring high precision even with complex layouts. 
Conclusion: 
By leveraging AWS services such as S3, API Gateway, Lambda, and Textract, we have developed a 
robust system for extracting text from images. This project showcases the power of cloud computing 
in streamlining text extraction tasks, offering scalability, automation, and accuracy. As organizations 
increasingly rely on digital data, solutions like this play a crucial role in unlocking insights from imagebased content.
